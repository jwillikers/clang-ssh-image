A container image for running the {Clang} toolchain from an {OpenSSH} server, built on {Fedora}.
Comes complete with CMake, Conan, Ninja, and Clang tools.

== Synopsis

This container is meant to be used with IDE's that support remote development over SSH, such as {CLion} and {Visual Studio Code}.
You might find this workflow particularly helpful if you develop on an immutable base operating system, such as {Fedora Silverblue}.

Image:: https://quay.io/repository/jwillikers/clang-ssh[quay.io/jwillikers/clang-ssh]

Tags::
* `latest`

Supported architectures::
* `amd64` _(x86_64)_
* `arm` _(armhfp)_
* `arm64` _(aarch64)_

Users::
`root`::: The default user inside the container is `root` since the OpenSSH server must be started by the superuser.
`user`::: A user named `user` is also created with the default password `password`.

Volumes::
`/etc/ssh`::: Where the container's own server-side SSH keys reside as well as various configuration files.
`/home/user/.ssh`::: The default user's SSH keys and configuration.

Cmd:: `["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D", "-e"]`

Labels::
`io.containers.autoupdate=registry`::: Enables automatic updates when using {Podman} and the _fully-qualified_ image name.

== Quick Start

. To run the OpenSSH server from this image, run the container using {Podman}.
+
--
Use the `-p` flag to port-forward the SSH port, port 22, from the container to the host.
To attach a device such as a serial console, add the `--security-opt label=disable` to disable SELinux and pass through the desired device with the `--device` flag.
The following example forwards port 22 in the container to port 2222 on localhost and allows access to the device `/dev/ttyBmpGdb`.

[source,sh]
----
podman run \
  --rm \
  -p 2222:22 \
  --security-opt label=disable \
  --device /dev/ttyBmpGdb:/dev/ttyBmpGdb \
  --name clang-ssh \
  -dt quay.io/jwillikers/clang-ssh:latest
----

[NOTE]
====
To access the SSH server from another container, simply run the containers in the same pod.
This doesn't even require port forwarding!
====
--

. The container should then be accessible using SSH from the local machine.
+
[source,sh]
----
ssh -p 2222 user@127.0.0.1
----

. Enter the default password for the user named `user`, which is `password`.

== Build

This project uses {Buildah} and {Podman} for building and testing the image.
A set of {pre-commit} checks are readily available to ensure your code is up-to-spec at the time it is committed.
Instructions for setting up a development environment, building the image, and testing the image follow.
These instructions are intended for users of {Fedora-Silverblue}, where the packages `buildah`, `git`, and `podman` are already available.
Moreover, I use the {fish} shell.

. Install the {fish} shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install fish
----

. Reboot to finish the installation.
+
[source,sh]
----
systemctl reboot
----

. Clone this repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone git@github.com:jwillikers/clang-ssh-image.git
----

. Install {pre-commit}.
+
[source,sh]
----
pip install pre-commit
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/clang-ssh-image
----

. Install pre-commit's Git hooks.
+
[source,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. Run the shell script to build the image.
+
[source,sh]
----
buildah unshare ~/Projects/clang-ssh-image/build.fish
----

. Test the image with the `test.fish` shell script.
+
[source,sh]
----
~/Projects/clang-ssh-image/test.fish
----
